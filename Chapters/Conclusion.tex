security measures will never be fully secure so all we can do is make it not worth the attackers while. At the moment there are so many devices that simply have no protection (web security ``hack'' example pls), so by having even the minimal amount of protection you can dissuade would be attackers because they have plenty of easier targets. Or make it so that the reward of breaking into your system simply is not worth the effort.


The Arduino's are by no means perfect. If you are having difficultly in a sketch then move variables around, in and out of setup. There were a few occasions where moving a variable out or into setup() fixed the problem. That is absurd.
